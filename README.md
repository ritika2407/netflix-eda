## Project Aim and Objectives

The aim of the project is to analyse key characteristics and trends for TV Shows and Movies in the Netflix Dataset. Since I am from India and the dataset has around 12% values for content produced in India which is second only to US which is at 33%, I will be taking a deeper dive into the trends and characteritics for content produced in India. Below are the main steps I will pe performing:

__i.__ The dataset will be inspected for data quality issues and issues like missing values, outliers etc. will be handled.

__ii.__ The dataset will be classified into different classes according to their characteristics (e.g. TV Show vs Movie or different values in any other column) and key trends will be identified.

__iii.__ The dataset will be visualised in different ways via different graps and plots to represent key trends and characteristics.
